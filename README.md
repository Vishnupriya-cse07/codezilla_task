Task 2: Fundamental Programming -Sum of Digits — Take an integer N and print the sum of its digits, Leap Year Checker — Check if a given year is a leap year, reverse a word — using loops (no built-in functions).

# SUM OF DIGITS:
To find the sum of digits:
  example:
  input:if the input 16 is given-
  output: 1+6=7


# TO CHECK THE LEAP YEAR OR NOT:
   For checking the leap year,the condition should be the year which the user given should be either divisible by 4 and 400 but it should not be divisible by 100
   example: 2024 is leap year since it is divisible by 4
   but,when the input is 1900,it is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100.
   

# TO REVERSE THE WORD:
    When the user(input) gives:
    THE STRING :HELLO
    THE OUTPUT :OLLEH
